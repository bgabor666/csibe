# CSiBE

[CSiBE](http://www.csibe.org) is a code size benchmark for compilers.

The primary purpose of CSiBE is to monitor the size of the binary code generated by a compiler.

## Basic usage

To create a new measurement project first checkout out 'bin/create_sample_project' script. This will help you through to create your own measurement. To create a measurement project that uses a cross-compiler check out the 'bin/create_sample_cross_compile_project' script.
