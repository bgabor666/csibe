Licenses:
        This software  (except some sources in the `src' directory;  see file
        CSiBE-README in the `src' directory) is free; you can redistribute it
        and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
        published  by  the Free Software Foundation;  either version 2 of the
        License, or (at your option) any later version.

Usage:
        The  `create-config'  program creates a new directory.  It copies and
        processes the sources  from the `src' directory.  By typing `make' or
        `make result'  in this new directory the sources are compiled and the
        sizes and  compilation times of  the resulting objects  are measured.
        The size and time results of the measurements are placed in the files
        `result-size.csv' and `result-time.csv'.
        
        Note,  that additional sources can be downloaded to perform execution
        time measurement.

        To configure the measurement the switches of  `create-config'  can be
        used (type `create-config -h' for the available switches).
